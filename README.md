# Inference of Cancer-Specific Gene Regulatory Networks from Integrated Single-Cell Multi-Omics

## Overview  
This repository contains the code for inferring cancer-specific Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from integrated single-cell multi-omics data. The method combines gene expression (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) data to reconstruct a regulatory landscape of cancer cells, adapting a network model originally developed for pluripotent stem cells. The goal is to identify key transcription factors (TFs) that drive oncogenic programs and contribute to tumor heterogeneity and disease progression.
